# KAMISH

Kamish, a traveler who can jump between dimensions, is stuck! He's lost his way home and landed in a strange place called the Shardlands. This world is made of many floating islands, and each one has a piece of a special bow and arrow he needs. To get back home, Kamish must solve unique puzzles on these islands to collect the magical bow and arrow.

Every puzzle he solves gives him something important for the next one. The final goal is to put together the magical bow and arrow. Once it's complete, a random target will appear, and shooting it will send Kamish back to his own dimension.

Each island in the Shardlands has its own puzzle, and they're all connected. You'll need to solve them in a specific order to get what you need: Hopeful Island (Music Puzzle): You'll find a mystical piano here. To solve it, you need to play the correct sequence of notes. Listen carefully to the music playing in the background on this islandâ€”it may be useful! When you play the right notes, you'll get the missing lever for the Lever Puzzle. Cheerful Island (Bush Puzzle): This island has glowing bushes. You need to walk on all the bushes in the correct path to light them up. Solving this puzzle gives you a clue for the Lever Puzzle, telling you how to set it up. Melancholy Island (Lever Puzzle): This puzzle has several levers, but one is missing (you get it from the Hopeful Island). You'll need to arrange the levers correctly using the clue from the Cheerful Island. When you solve it, you'll get the magical bow! You can also find arrows scattered around the Shardlands. Make sure to pick them up to use with your bow!
